I am currently a graduate student at the School of Intelligent Science and Technology at Peking University, under the supervision of Prof. [Dingsheng Luo](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37340369700). I anticipate completing my Master's degree in July 2025. My research primarily revolves around Intelligent Robotics and Motion Control, especially in conjunction with human recognition mechanisms. I actively conduct experiments in both simulation and real, working with various robotic platforms such as UR3-AUBOi5 dual-arm robot, Baxter, Realman mobile manipulation robot, PKU-HR humanoid robot, and others.

Majoring in Automation and Artificial Intelligence. During this period, my focus was on the control of quadcopters and mobile manipulation.

Outside of academia, I enjoy playing football (soccer), swimming, and hitting the gym. Additionally, I have a passion for music and can often be found with airpods in hand â€“ I simply can't stay away! The guitar and flute are my constant companions. :sparkles:
