<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically. -->

I am currently a graduate student at the School of Intelligent Science and Technology at Peking University, under the supervision of Prof. [Dingsheng Luo](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37340369700). I anticipate completing my Master's degree in July 2025. My research focuses on intelligent robots, with a particular emphasis on motion control and perception, especially when integrated with human recognition mechanisms. I actively conduct experiments in both simulation and real world, working with various robot platforms such as UR3-AUBOi5 dual-arm robot, Baxter, Realman mobile manipulation robot, PKU-HR humanoid robot, VR teleoperation and others. 

I earned my Bachelor's degree from North China Electric Power University, Majoring in Automation and Artificial Intelligence. During this period, my focus was on the control of quadcopters and mobile manipulation with classical methods, like PID, Fussy control, et al.

<!-- Outside of academia, I enjoy playing football (soccer), swimming, and hitting the gym. Additionally, I have a passion for music and can often be found with airpods in hand – I simply can't stay away! The guitar and flute are my constant companions. :sparkles: -->
