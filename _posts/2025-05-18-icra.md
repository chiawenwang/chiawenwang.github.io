This is a brief summary of my experience at ICRA 2025 in Atlanta, Georgia (May 18 - 23), consisting with different excellent works, keynotes and communications. It's really a great conference, and I hope to share some highlights with you all! 😊

### 🔥 A Fantastic Debate — Data will Solve Robotics and Automation: True or False?

One of the most engaging sessions I attended at ICRA 2025 was this lively debate on a core question: **"Is data all you need?"** Ken kicked things off by emphasizing that everything hinges on the **scale** of data. Interestingly, most of the live audience leaned toward the False side — reflecting real-world experience with deploying data-driven models in complex, messy environments.


Here’s a quick breakdown of the debate:

- ✅ **True Side**
  - Data is the foundation of AI and robotics.

  - With sufficient data, models can generalize to unseen scenarios.

  - LLMs and foundation models have shown strong performance across domains — even in robotics.

- ❌ **False Side**
  - No model can perfectly capture the real world using limited data.

  - Real-world environments are inherently dynamic and unpredictable.

  - Data-driven models often fail when faced with out-of-distribution inputs.

#### My Thoughts

Personally, I was on the False side of the debate — but I’d say it’s not a black-and-white issue.

Whether you're using classical control methods or modern learning-based approaches, data is indispensable. The real question is whether data alone can solve the complexities of robotics.

Take PID control as an example. While it’s not considered a “data-driven” method in the machine learning sense, tuning it still relies heavily on feedback data and human experince. On the other hand, learning-based methods explicitly rely on large datasets to train models — making them inherently data-driven. Even humans, in a way, are models trained on life-long data.

So yes, I argued against the proposition, but that doesn’t mean I dismiss the central role of data in robotics. Quite the opposite — data is necessary, but not always sufficient.

#### The Debate Vibe

What made this debate so enjoyable wasn’t just the topic, but the people.

**Professor Leslie** was full of energy — a delightful and charismatic presence who truly lit up the room. Her enthusiasm was contagious and kept the audience engaged from start to finish.

**Ken**, on the other hand, was absolutely hilarious. He delivered his points with a sharp, witty sense of humor that had just the right amount of bite — never mean-spirited, but always entertaining. Below is a photo of him and me after the session.

The ICRA 2025 keynote on manipulation brought together leading researchers to discuss the future of robotic interaction with the physical world.

Professor **Shuran Song** also organized a workshop on [Dexterous Manipulation](https://sites.google.com/view/dexterity-workshop-icra2025/home), where she introduced two key strategies for tackling the challenges of dexterous manipulation:

1. **Reducing the Embodiment Gap** – representations like DexUmi.

2. **Represent the Embodiment Differences in Policy Design** – using unified representations like GET-Zero.

### 📍 On the Ground @Atlanta

Atlanta is a vibrant city, home to renowned institutions like Georgia Tech and Emory University, as well as the world-famous Coca-Cola company. During my visit, I had the chance to explore the **Georgia Tech** campus and the World of **Coca-Cola Museum** — both inspiring in very different ways!
